Over the past three La Liga seasons (2022-2023, 2023-2024, and the ongoing 2024-2025 season), Barcelona and Real Madrid have consistently finished in the top two positions, showcasing their dominance in the league. Here's a breakdown of their performance each season:

*   **Goals Conceded:** Barcelona boasted a significantly better defensive record, conceding just 20 goals compared to Real Madrid's 36.
*   **Goal Difference:** Barcelona had a superior goal difference of +50 compared to Real Madrid's +39.
*   **Expected Goals (xG):** Both teams had the same Expected Goals value of 75.5, suggesting similar quality in attacking chances created.
*   **Expected Goals Against (xGA):** Barcelona's Expected Goals Against was 33.2, indicating they were expected to concede fewer goals than Real Madrid, whose xGA was 38.9.

In 2022-2023, Barcelona's title win was underpinned by a remarkably strong defense, although Real Madrid edged them slightly in actual goals scored. Expected metrics suggested a similar attacking output but a clear defensive advantage for Barcelona.

**2023-2024 Season:**

*   **League Position:** Real Madrid claimed the title (1st), with Barcelona finishing 2nd.
*   **Points:** Real Madrid earned 95 points, 10 more than Barcelona's 85.

The 2023-2024 season saw a reversal, with Real Madrid finishing comfortably ahead of Barcelona, driven by a potent attack and solid defense. Despite Barcelona generating slightly better quality chances going forward (higher xG and xGD), Real Madrid's clinical finishing and defensive strength (lower actual GA) proved decisive.

**2024-2025 Season (Ongoing - Data from 34 or 35 matches):**

*   **League Position:** As of the latest data, Barcelona are leading the league (1st), followed by Real Madrid (2nd).

*   **Top Scorer:** Robert Lewandowski leads Barcelona with 25 goals. Kylian Mbappé is Real Madrid's top scorer with 24.
*   **Main Goalkeeper:** Iñaki Peña for Barcelona and Thibaut Courtois for Real Madrid.

In the current season, Barcelona holds a slight edge in points and a significant lead in goals scored and Expected Goal metrics. Defensively, their actual goals conceded record is identical, although expected data suggests Barcelona should have conceded marginally fewer.

**Summary across the seasons:**

Both clubs have maintained their status as the top two teams in La Liga. Barcelona won the title in 2022-2023 and are currently leading in 2024-2025, while Real Madrid were champions in 2023-2024.

Barcelona consistently generates higher Expected Goals (xG) and Expected Goal Difference (xGD) over these seasons, suggesting they create a greater volume and quality of attacking opportunities. However, Real Madrid demonstrated superior efficiency in converting chances (scoring more than their xG in 2023-2024) and a slightly better actual defensive record in 2023-2024 despite Barcelona's lower Expected Goals Against in two of the three seasons.

The goal difference fluctuates, heavily influenced by goals scored and conceded in each specific season. Top scorers have varied, with Lewandowski being a consistent threat for Barcelona, while Real Madrid's top spot was held by Benzema, Bellingham, and Mbappé in successive seasons. The goalkeeper situation has also seen changes, particularly for Real Madrid.
