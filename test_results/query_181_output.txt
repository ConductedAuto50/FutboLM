QUERY: What happened in Bayern Munich's last Bundesliga match? Include score, scorers, and a brief highlight.

EXPECTED:
Score, scorers for both teams, and one key highlight from Bayern Munich's last Bundesliga game.

RESPONSE:
In their last Bundesliga match on Saturday, May 10, Bayern Munich defeated Borussia Mönchengladbach 2-0 at the Allianz Arena.

The scoring was opened in the 31st minute when Harry Kane deflected a shot from Michael Olise for the first goal. Olise then sealed the victory himself with a goal in the 90th minute.

A significant highlight of the match was club icon Thomas Müller's farewell in his final home game after 25 years at Bayern. He received a brief ceremony before the game and a standing ovation when he was substituted late in the second half. Despite Gladbach starting in a more attacking fashion, Bayern secured the win, which also featured a successful comeback from injury for goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, who made a string of saves after halftime.
