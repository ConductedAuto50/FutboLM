EXPECTED:

RESPONSE:
In the 2022-23 Premier League season, Manchester City scored a total of 94 goals. Their expected goals (xG) for the season was 78.6. This indicates they scored 15.4 goals more than their xG suggested (94 actual goals minus 78.6 xG).

Arsenal finished the season with 88 goals scored. Their expected goals (xG) was 71.6, meaning they scored 16.4 goals more than their xG (88 actual goals minus 71.6 xG).
