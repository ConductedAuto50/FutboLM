QUERY: List all players who have won the Golden Boot in both the World Cup and European Championship.

EXPECTED:
A list of players who have been the top scorer (won the Golden Boot) in both a FIFA World Cup and a UEFA European Championship.

RESPONSE:
Based on the information provided, I cannot give you a list of all players who have won the Golden Boot in both the World Cup and the European Championship.

The text states that only two players have won the Golden Boot for the UCL, World Cup, *and* EURO, and that both of those players were associated with Bayern. However, it does not provide a list of players who won the Golden Boot in *only* the World Cup and EURO.
