QUERY: Provide a detailed summary of the Champions League final between Manchester City and Inter Milan in 2023

EXPECTED:
A detailed match report from ESPN including score, scorers, key moments, lineups, and possibly brief analysis of the 2023 Champions League final.

RESPONSE:
Manchester City secured their first-ever UEFA Champions League title on June 10, 2023, defeating Inter Milan 1-0 in the final held at Istanbul's Ataturk Olympic Stadium. The victory also saw City complete a historic treble, adding the Champions League trophy to their Premier League and FA Cup triumphs, becoming only the second English team, after Manchester United in 1999, and the 10th team overall in history to achieve this feat.

The decisive moment came in the 68th minute when midfielder Rodri scored the only goal of the match with a precisely struck finish from the edge of the penalty box, following a cutback from Bernardo Silva.

Despite entering the match as overwhelming favourites, Manchester City faced a stern challenge from Inter Milan in what was described as a scrappy, evenly matched final. Inter created several opportunities to equalize, coming agonizingly close. Federico Dimarco hit the crossbar with a header, and his follow-up was blocked by teammate Romelu Lukaku. Later, City goalkeeper Ederson made a crucial block to deny Lukaku's close-range header.

Manchester City also faced a setback in the first half when playmaker Kevin De Bruyne was forced off with a leg injury in the 36th minute, replaced by Phil Foden. City's Norwegian striker Erling Haaland had earlier chances but was denied by Inter keeper Andre Onana.

Ultimately, Pep Guardiola's side held on to claim the coveted European trophy, ending what the coach admitted was an "obsession." The win marked City's first European title since the 1969-70 European Cup Winners' Cup. The match was attended by 71,412 spectators and refereed by Szymon Marciniak.
